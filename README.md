# ChronoHelix

ChronoHelix is an AI-powered project designed to decode and reconstruct ancient DNA by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. This project utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and score-based diffusion models to repair fragmented DNA sequences and predict missing genetic data, unlocking new insights into human evolution, migration patterns, and the genetics of extinct species.

## Key Features
- Fragmented DNA Repair: Leverages GNNs to map and reconstruct degraded DNA sequences.
- Missing Data Prediction: Employs diffusion models to predict and fill gaps in ancient genetic material based on patterns from modern genomes.
- Evolutionary Insights: Provides enhanced tools for understanding human ancestry, migration, and extinct species' genomes

## Problem Statement
Ancient DNA is often degraded due to environmental factors, making it difficult to reconstruct and analyze. This limits our ability to study evolutionary history, migration patterns, and extinct species. ChronoHelix addresses this by applying AI techniques to improve the accuracy and completeness of ancient DNA reconstruction.

## Methodology
1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):
   - Maps relationships between DNA fragments.
   - Repairs damaged sequences by leveraging structural patterns.

2. Score-Based Diffusion Models:
   - Predicts missing genetic data using probabilistic methods.
   - Completes sequences by analyzing known genome patterns.

## Impact
ChronoHelix has the potential to:
- Advance the field of genomics by providing more accurate reconstructions of ancient DNA.
- Enable deeper insights into human evolution and migration patterns.
- Aid in the study of extinct species, contributing to biodiversity research.
